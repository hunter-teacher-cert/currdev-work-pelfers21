###Pick 2 different CS standards, for each descibe a task that addresses the standard and explain how.
###7-8.CY.1: Determine the types of personal information and digital resources that an individual may have access to that needs to be protected.
### Students will create a Public Service Announcement (PSA) in Scratch (7th Grade) or P5 (8th Grade) to demonstrate the ways we can stay safe on the Internet while still being able to browse and share information safely.  This culminating project will follow after several lessons on what needs to be kept private and what can be shared about personal information.  Students will learn that posting phone numbers, addresses, last names, school attended, and other personal identifying information can be very detrimental to their safety.  They will learn how to create Avatars of themselves in order to avoid posting pictures of themselves.  The PSA will include rules for being safe, steps to be taken to ensure safety, effects of not following these rules and how to communicate this information with friends.

###7-8.CY.2:  Describe physical, digital, and behavioral safeguards that can be employed in different situations. 
###Students will create a story with various endings to show what can happen if they fail to follow protocol for safeguarding their passwords, being careful not to download anything to their computer that they are unsure of, and being careful not to open emails that they do not know who they are from.  After several lessons on Password safety and creating passwords, keeping software updated, and not opening emails they are unsure of or downloading anything they are unsure of, they will create a story to show for example:  how a character would choose the correct option for a password versus what happens if you share a password with a friend, another character opening an email with a virus not knowing the sender vs a person deleting an email from an unknown sender, and an additional character not updating their antivirus software with secure settings vs. someone not updating the software and getting viruses on their computer.  This CS activity will be done in Scratch as a choose your own ending type of story line demonstrating the students knowledge of the effects of not being Cyber Safe.
