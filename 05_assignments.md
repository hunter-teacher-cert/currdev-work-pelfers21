# Introduction to P5 - Project One - Shapes-Face Project

Directions:  Using the graph you were introduced to today, graph the shapes we discussed:  line, ellipse, rectangle, triangle, quadrilateral.  Remember how the shapes are drawn:  where they are plotted and the sizes.  Be sure you fill the parameters requested.  For example:  ellipse(x, y, w, h) = (x coordinate, y coordinate (center pt of the circle), w-width in pixels, h-height in pixels).  After drawing and labeling the necessary points, go to http://editor.p5js.org and plot your shapes.  Be careful they donâ€™t overlap each other or cover over each other.  Use the reference sheet attached with the coordinate graph to help you plot your shapes on the graph and in the program. (A larger graph will given to you if needed).
