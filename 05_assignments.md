# Computer Science - Assignment One
# Introduction to P5 - Project One - Shapes-Face Project

Directions:  Using the graph you were introduced to today, graph the shapes we discussed:  line, ellipse, rectangle, triangle, quadrilateral.  Remember how the shapes are drawn:  where they are plotted and the sizes.  Be sure you fill the parameters requested.  For example:  ellipse(x, y, w, h) = (x coordinate, y coordinate (center pt of the circle), w-width in pixels, h-height in pixels).  After drawing and labeling the necessary points, go to http://editor.p5js.org and plot your shapes.  Be careful they donâ€™t overlap each other or cover over each other.  Use the reference sheet attached with the coordinate graph to help you plot your shapes on the graph and in the program. (A larger graph will given to you if needed).

Computer Science 
P5 - Using Color With Shapes

Directions:  Now that you have plotted your first shapes, we are going to use what we learned today to fill them in with color.  Create a program/sketch in P5 that will use what you have learned to create a face including color and include at least eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and a hat.  If you want to add more details you may.  Be creative.  Remember-hint: whatever color you want a shape to be, you must put the color before the shape, not after.  Also remember that the program is technically always running in the background like a forever loop running from top to bottom and back!  Here are some helpful reminders on color:  strokeWeight(), stroke(),  noStroke(), fill(R,G,B).  Use http://htmlcolorcodes.com to find the colors you want and copy the RGB codes.  Use the graph to plot your points so that you have an idea of where you want to place your shapes and then plot them in the P5 editor!  Below is a sample of one I did https://editor.p5js.org/pelfers/full/7smxM30pr   Below is a copy of the graph and the references needed for this assignment.
