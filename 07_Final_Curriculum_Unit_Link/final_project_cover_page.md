Abstraction and Decomposition: 
7-8.CT.4 Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task.

7-8.CT.5 Identify multiple similar concrete computations in a program, then create a function to generalize over them using parameters to accommodate their differences.

Algorithms and Programming:
7-8.CT.6 Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.

7-8.CT.7 Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.

7-8.CT.8 Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem.

7-8.CT.9 Read and interpret code to predict the outcome of various programs that involve conditionals and repetition for the purposes of debugging.
