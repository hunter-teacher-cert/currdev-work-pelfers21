##Course:  Graphic Design with P5 - JavaScript

###This course will teach text-based programming with the use of P5 - JavaScript.  Students will have previously had the basics of HTML/CSS and will be introduced to adding interactivity to their web pages.  We will use previously made web pages and add JavaScript to them by copying our HTML/CSS from CodePen to the P5 platform.  In P5 students will be introduced to basic shapes and colors first, and on to motion and adding external images and sounds.  Incorporated into the course will be adding the students family background information, ie: country of origin, languages spoken, flags, hobbies, family traditions, etc.  

###Continuation of study can be an exploration in game design creating a simple game related to their familyâ€™s origin.

###This course will be designed for 8th/9th graders in our Computer Science Talent Elective.

###This course can be integrated with a social studies unit on multiculturalism including all family backgrounds from each class the course is introduced in. It can also be integrated with a literacy lesson the includes non-fiction literature about families from around the world.
