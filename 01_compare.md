## Assignment:
* filename: **01_compare.md**
* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with 
* similar focus).
  * If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
  * For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide 
  * intro courses at the least.
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative strengths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem eqully good then no need to 
  * comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

##I have taught P5 - Processing/Javascript using curriculum that was developed by CS4ALL.  Their units are not prepackaged and are able to be edited 
and modified to meet the level of learners you are teaching.  I took both Creative Web (Middle School Level and Introduction to Computational Media 
(High School Level).  Both levels were completely able to be modified and even, in some cases, combined.  The units were all project based and each 
lesson had several mini projects to develop the conceptual knowledge needed for the final unit projects, each of which I modified.  They also provide 
handouts and materials and PowerPoints designed for teaching teachers which can be modified for teaching students.  Rubrics were also provided for the 
projects.  P5 itself lends for a lot of resources including translation to several languages for directions but not directly in the program.  They also 
have a reference page with code snippets for additional help with programming the code.

##This past year I used Code.org to teach some JavaScript.  Code.org provides unit lessons and materials that are geared for Middle schoolers in their CS 
Discoveries Series.  JavaScript is one of them.  Each lesson is designed to build on the concepts needed for a final project.  Rubrics are provided for 
the unit project.  There are teacher lessons and slide decks provided for each lesson.  There is also additional teacher and student resources such as 
models for the teacher and handouts for the students.  Code.org has translation capability into various languages in the directions and in the program.

##In looking at the differences, CS4ALL - although could be considered “pre-packages”, it is still created by educators with the knowledge that units can be 
modified and adapted as needed.  Code.org is completely packaged and also includes assessments that CS4ALL does not.  CS4ALL’s lessons are more detailed 
but Code.org’s lessons are outlined to the slide decks and also include links for the teachers to access the various resources in each lesson.  Code.org 
also has the option of using block-based coding or text-based coding with the adjustment of the view from blocks to text-based.  This may be a strength 
for Code.org. program since many of the students I teach are just coming from block based coding into text-based for the first time.  P5 does not offer 
block-based coding and my not be so easily understood by students just coming from block based coding.  

##For my program this year, I am going to introduce first HTML/CSS with Code.org and then add the JavaScript first with the Code.org -block based then ask 
the students to transition to the text-based and move into P5.  I think this will be beneficial and help the students to understand how the blocks 
translate into text.  I also would like to use the graph created by CS4ALL’s program to incorporate into the Code.org program so that students can grasp 
the difference between the coordinates on the graph used in Scratch versus those used in P5.
